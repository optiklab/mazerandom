# mazerandom
Random maze generator with no guarantee of having solution.

The main differences from [mazegenerator](https://github.com/optiklab/mazegenerator) are:
1. Here is NO Graph underneath of the generation algorithm.
2. There is no particular fixed entry point or exit point.

It's very simple, but in the same time, there is no guarantee to have a solution.
